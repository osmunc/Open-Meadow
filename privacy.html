<h2>3. How we share your information</h2>

</ul>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable safeguards (like encryption in transit and secure servers) to protect your data. However, no system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

<h2>6. Children’s privacy</h2>
<p>Joy AR is intended for use by parents and adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or under the minimum age required by local laws). If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us to delete it.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we’ll notify you via Joy AR or by other reasonable means. Continued use of Joy AR after updates means you accept the revised Policy.</p>
